# Introduction

Apify is a small library and a clean alternative to enterprise frameworks. 
It's extremely easy to use and allows you to quickly create anything from a 
Web application to a RESTful Web service. If you are familiar with the Zend 
Framework then you already know how to use Apify.

Web services are a great way to extend your application, however, adding a Web API 
to an existing web application can be a tedious and time-consuming task. Apify was 
developed to ease that pain. It takes certain common patterns found in most web services 
and abstract them so that you can quickly write Web APIs without having to write too much 
code ([example][9]).
